# Embed QuickSight Dashboard sample

This is a sample code which illustrates how to embed quick sight dashboard.

This sample code has mainly two parts:

- api : this is a serverless lambda which is required to generate the embedded url for quick sight
- web : simple create react app which embeds the dashboard
 
***Note***
I am leaving the .env file checked in as part of sample code so you know what env variables you have to pass. 
Feel free to fork this.

Happy coding!
